# Awesome-ADB-toolkits



### Why we need this?

Because ADB command is too hard to be remebered.



### Getting Started

Just add the Awesome-ADB-toolkits into your `~/.bashrc`



```bash
# Awesome-ADB-toolkits
export Awesome-ADB-toolkits/environment
```



If you are using fish shell, add to your `~/.config/fish/config`
